# California Public Schools by Zip Code

This is a project for week 4 of Coursera's Developing Data Products. The data 
used for this project can be found at the [California Department of Education](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp). The Shiny App allows 
users to enter a five digit California zip code and returns a map of 
California public schools in that area.
